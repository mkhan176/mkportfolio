                        <b>Our Goal</b><br>  Over the course of a year, I assembled a talented team with a mission to develop 
                        a cutting-edge e-commerce platform for buying and selling laptops. Guided by extensive market research, 
                        my goal was to deliver a unique and user-friendly experience, catering to the growing demand for laptop sales. 
                        By creating an aesthetically pleasing application, my aim was to make the purchasing and selling process
                         as effortless as possible for our users.<br><br>

                        
                        <b>My Role</b><br> Stakeholder/UX designer<br>
                        I played a crucial role in designing the user experience of my e-commerce platform as the lead UX researcher. 
                        I conducted user research, created user personas, developed sitemaps, wireframes, prototypes, 
                        and mockups to deliver a seamless and intuitive platform for buyers and sellers.<br><br>


                        <b>Length of project</b><br>
                        September 2022 - September 2023<br><br>

                        <b>Tools used</b><br>
                        Adobe XD | Figma| Illustrator<br><br>


                        <b>Discover phase - initial research </b><br>
                        My research journey began with a focus on gaining a deeper understanding of the project at hand. I asked myself key questions, including...<br><br>
                        
                        • What are the business goals?<br><br>
                        • What are we trying to build?<br><br>
                        • What does the product do?<br><br>
                        • Who is our target audience?<br><br>
                        • Are there any competitors?<br><br>

                        <b>Define Phase</b><br>
                        My research led to the synthesis of insights and the creation of a feature priority list and definition of business requirements. 
                        It was determined that the expected market size will reach 3,477,296 million by 2025. <p class="mb-4"> <b>Consolidated requirement</b><br>Developing a platform for buyers and sellers.

                    <p><b>Develop Phase</b><br>
                        I delved into the exploration of concepts and designs, engaging in brainstorming sessions to generate ideas and using Figma to create wireframe sketches. 
                        Subsequently, a functional prototype was developed using Adobe XD.<br><br>

                        <b>Usability tests</b><br>
                        I conducted usability tests on the first iteration of our prototype, utilizing a sample of 5 experienced e-commerce users to assess the ease and efficiency of completing various tasks. 
                        The aim was to ensure a smooth and satisfying user experience. Following the testing, I conducted personal interviews with each participant to gather further feedback and insights into their experience. <br><br>
                        
                        The outcomes of my tests indicated that users were encountering difficulties in completing tasks in a timely manner, and were encountering frustration due to unclear icons. Additionally,
                         users reported feeling overwhelmed by the layout and information presented on the homepage, which was found to hinder their ability to complete tasks efficiently. 
                         In response to these findings, I made the decision to redesign the homepage to address these issues and improve the overall user experience.  
                        <br><br>

                        <b>The problem</b><br>
                        The issue at hand is a cluttered design that lacks visual hierarchy, causing confusion for users in determining what is relevant and important. 
                        The current design presents an excessive amount of information and unclear logos, and the sizing of boxes is inconsistent, leading to a poor user experience.<br><br>

                        <b>Decluttered process</b>
                        Initially, I compiled a list of all the pain points from the previous interface. Based on this information, I made decisions about which content was critical and necessary to keep, and what could be removed. 
                        To enhance the design, I applied Fitts' law to redesign the logos and adjust the size of the boxes, with the aim of reducing clutter and creating a more organized and visually appealing interface. 
                        The result was a less confusing, more streamlined, and aesthetically pleasing design.<br><br>
